                First, let's introduce my undergraduate institution: the University of Portsmouth. Located on the south coast of England, Portsmouth is a beautiful seaside city, just 90 minutes from London (by train) to Heathrow Airport in just 1 hour, is one of the UK's largest and busiest ports, daily ferry services between France and Spain, a British Royal Navy base, and many fascinating places of interest. Portsmouth is also the birthplace of the great Victorian novelist Charles Dickens. Across the sea from the Isle of Wight, it is a tourist destination. The University of Portsmouth is a public comprehensive university and a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the European University Association. The University of Portsmouth has five faculties (Business Law, Creative and Cultural Industries, Humanities and Social Sciences, Science and Health, and Engineering, and I graduated from the University of Portsmouth's Business School. My undergraduate major was International Business. Graduated in 2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was followed by my graduate school: Cardiff University. Cardiff University has the most beautiful campus in Europe, and has been selected as the most beautiful campus in the UK for many times, and Cardiff University is the designated filming location for many British dramas and American dramas that are popular all over the world. (e.g. Sherlock, Doctor Who, etc.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Cardiff University's computer facilities and modern libraries are among the best in the UK. The university has several resource centers, each located near the faculties it serves. The number of computers is numerous and open to students day and night, providing free e-mail, Internet browsing, and access to a variety of online resources. Cardiff University has a state-of-the-art library and information technology services, and cutting-edge computer technology is widely used to support research and teaching. I liked it very much.          </div>

                I started my own luxury trading business in 2017, when I was 18 years old and just started college, and over the years of my business, my language expression skills and business thinking have been greatly improved due to the continuous contact/communication with different people. In 2018 and 2019, I set foot in the two free trade ports of Hong Kong and Macau many times, and worked outside the home many times, which cultivated my personal self-care ability and continuous learning ability. And it has allowed me to see a lot of shortcomings and areas that can be changed. Since I majored in international business, it complemented my business. I am constantly able to deeply understand the knowledge I have learned in books and apply it. In 2020, I opened a Taobao store in China. Similar to Amazon stores in the UK. Working on the internet led me to a deeper understanding and interest in the science of computing, and I applied for a computer major in Cardiff in 2021. Through these five years of work experience, my whole person has improved a lot, improved my cognition, insight, vision, and comprehensively exercised my learning ability, language expression ability and work ability. And I can not only learn the knowledge in books from school, but also continue to practice to confirm what I have learned, so that I can better absorb knowledge from school.

                First of all, I want to study the knowledge that I need to learn in the computer major in graduate school thoroughly. Secondly, I want to apply for a second master's degree in the top 50 universities in QS with my graduate grades at Cardiff University, and secondly, I have a deeper understanding that I still have to learn some more in-depth business knowledge, so I want to apply for a business major in the top 50 universities in QS to better learn knowledge. Secondly, I will learn business knowledge well during my second master's degree, and apply it to practice (that is, my luxury trading business) and try to do it better. Secondly, after graduation, I want to try to enter a Fortune 500 company to learn and accumulate work experience and company experience. Constantly learn the advantages of colleagues in the company and better improve yourself. After studying in the company for a few years, relying on my personal business experience and learning experience in the company, I opened my own business company through my own efforts to continuously develop my own business dreams. At the same time, I will also continue to look for the business direction I want to do in my studies and work, and in my working time, I will continue to think and contact the business direction I want to do, and then open my own business company and complete my dream.            </p>
